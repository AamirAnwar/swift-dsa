- Every single interviewer is assigned a few leadership principles gauge the candidate on 
- Groups in Amazon use the LPs as guiding lights and have mini startups within the company

## Leadership Principles 

### Customer Obsession 
We all understand that the company performs better if our customers (and our employees) believe it’s acting in our best interest.
We’ve regularly made decisions at Amazon which lowered profit/sales, because it was the right thing to do for customers.

### Invent and Simplify 
Keep it simple stupid (KISS) 
MVP is firmly entrenched
We need people with a capacity for infinite ideas
We need the question of “What else?” to be met by such a long stream of answers that it would take us forever to try them all.
Simplicity allows for faster and cheaper innovation, and that’s why they’re married together with the principle of removing code and simplifying the code base


### Are right a lot
Get forgiveness instead of permission
question their own decisions and be open to counter opinions.
Right and wrong are a matter of knowing what you are trying to accomplish, what the options are, and how to compare the merit of the options
every perspective and opinion needs to be valued

### Learn and be curious
What new thing have you learned recently?
we do need is for you to be open and interested in learning new things.


### Hire and develop the best
If you’re comfortable, you’re not growing
We believe it’s the responsibility of every single person to help others grow. 
Pair up new joinees with recent joinees 

### Insist on the highest standards

We expect our leaders to be proud owners of the things they own, and as such, insist on standards which everyone (including themselves) should struggle to meet.
There's always a better, faster and more ingenious way to do something

Our goal is never to deliver to requirements — to only meet our goals. At all times — once you look past our official project goals — our goal is to improve. 
Our goal is to never accept that something is broken, to never feel that anything less than a perfect product is acceptable.

We care about fixing the root causes of problems (not just hiding or patching them). We care that you are always thinking “I know we can do better than this”.

### Think Big

If we are asking you in an interview for an idea, you can’t say the first small idea which pops in your head, and believe you’ve satisfied the requirement
When I’m interviewing someone, I prefer to think that someone’s idea is somewhat impossible, because explaining constraints to a co-worker is easier than explaining how to invent and think.


### Bias for Action
I know at your company it’s possible that you’re encouraged to not take action unless asked, but we find that unacceptable.
We want leaders who take action, are bold, are willing to take risks, because they know it’s the right thing to do.
For almost every major human-caused accident at Amazon, there’s a sheepish person who raises their hand and says “Yeah.. that was me”. And they’re still here, because we value calculated risk taking.
We value this type of risk taking, because we need to move fast in areas where we can’t possibly know the right answer. Option A or Option B? Pick and move on.

### Frugality 
Love stretch goals
This principle is all about ensuring that we can provide as much value for as little cost as possible
Things never cost what they cost, because we can always do less, do it cheaper, do it slower, do it with lower quality.We always have options.
We’re inventing to solve problems in a cheaper way. Which often is faster, easier to maintain, easier to extend, etc.
When you’re interviewing, we’re looking for you to understand that having not enough time or resources is a fine and expected thing. Having too much to do, and too little time is perfectly ok. Not doing everything you want on a project is healthy, because doing everything you ever wanted to do is inefficient.

## Earn Trust
Be vocally self-critical
When you’re explaining a mistake, first recognize your own, before explaining other misses.
It’s not about pointing blame, it’s about fixing processes.
As an interviewer, think carefully about how you deal with mistakes, both yours and others. We care about long term, not short. We care about fixing problems, not blaming. 
because we’re so decentralized, it’s critical that we trust those who we work with, because each of us have a lot of power and responsibility.


## Dive deep
“Trust yet verify” is a favorite phrase at Amazon.
If you increased traffic, you better know what you did. If you dropped error rates, you should know what the errors were. 
We care that people know details, because it means they cared enough to question things. We need curious and skeptical leaders.
I love when I ask questions of people, and they can go 4 or 5 levels deep, and keep getting more excited because the details are actually interesting to them.

### Have a backbone, disagree and commit
We never find it acceptable to do something because your boss said to. 
We do things because it’s the decision we’ve made, and with the data we’ve gathered, we’ve committed to that plan.
Data based disagreements are great. We use them all the time at Amazon, and examples of when you gathered data to make an argument are great.
As a leader, we can never feel (and certainly not express) glee in the failure of others. Cheering at others failures suggests that you’re playing a zero sum game, and the game is not zero sum within Amazon. 
“I told you so” is never acceptable
We need leaders who are able to recognize when disagreements are needed, and when they’re not. What’s worth arguing about, and what’s not. What’s worth escalating, and when it’s time to move on and start delivering. And we need to believe that you’re that type of person.

### Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. 
Do you know your key inputs?
We need people to recognize that they’re not accomplishing tasks, they’re focusing on inputs for their business. 
It is much harder (and much better) to focus on the business itself, rather than completing tasks.
Also, timely fashion, setbacks, and never settling
before you get yourself too wrapped up insisting on high standards, keep in mind that we’re extremely pragmatic. And we’re all about delivering the right results
